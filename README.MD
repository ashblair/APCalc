APCalc stands for Adjustable Precision Calculator.
The initial precision is 1000 decimal digits.
Numbers are displayed in scientific notation.
Exponents are indicated with a very cool drop 10 symbol inherited from ALGOL (Decimal Exponent Symbol U+23E8 TTF).
Coding was done in C++ on Linux with library gtkmm-3.0
The widgets were GTK Gnome Tool Kit widgets set up with Glade.
The make file expects directories: bin, dep, inc, obj, obj/dbg, obj/rel, rsc, share, & src.
